This is my solution to the Knight's Travails programming challenge found at https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms.

In addition to solving this problem, it is also possible to find the shortest path for a Queen piece.  All code written using TDD best practices.
